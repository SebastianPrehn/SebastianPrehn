I hold a BSc in Computer Science from the University of Copenhagen at DIKU, where I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in the same field.
My academic interests lie in computer architecture, storage systems, embedded and distributed systems, and high-performance computing.
I am also passionate about Computer Security, and how it plays into these other interests.
Reproducibility and correctness of code is also something I care deeply about, and something I am trying to become better at including in all my projects.
Beyond these core interests, I am fascinated by how technologies like 3D printing and virtual reality and how they can better lives.

Outside study and work, I like to tinker with software when time permits, especially GNU Emacs, my editor of choice, and other libre or open source software. I also love watching movies and reading, particularly in the genres of fantasy and science fiction.
