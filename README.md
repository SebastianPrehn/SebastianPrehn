I am a student at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark. I am interested in language theory, High Performance Computing, as well as reproducibility and correctness of code. I also have a fascination in Human-Centred Interaction and how utilizing technologies like 3D printers and Virtual Reality could better lives.

I am a firm proponent of Free & open-source software, and its spread.

I am currently focusing on my studies and work, but I like to tinker with software when time permits, especially GNU Emacs.
