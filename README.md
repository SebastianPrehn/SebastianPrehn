I am a student at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark. I am interested in Human-Centred Interaction and how utilizing technologies like 3D printers and Virtual Reality could better lives. I also have a great fascination with High Performance Computing, as well as reproducibility and correctness of code, and am spending more time lately on that. I am a firm proponent of Free & open-source software, and its spread.

I am currently focusing on my studies and work, but I like to tinker with software when time permits, especially GNU Emacs.
