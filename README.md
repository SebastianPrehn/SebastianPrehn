I am a student at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark. 
I am especially interested in computer systems, High Performance Computing, Computer Security as well as reproducibility and correctness of code. I also have a fascination in Computer Security, as well as how utilizing technologies like 3D printers and Virtual Reality could better lives.

I am currently focusing on my studies and work, but I like to tinker with software when time permits.
